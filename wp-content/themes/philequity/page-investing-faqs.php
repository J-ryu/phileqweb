												A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools together the funds of various investors---both individuals and corporations. 
												The pool of funds is managed by a professional fund manager who uses the funds to create a diversified investment portfolio 
												consisting of various investment instruments such as stocks and bonds.

													For an affordable initial investment amount, you gain access to various potentially higher yielding investments normally 
													available to investors with much larger funds to invest.  A mutual fund makes this possible because it pools together 
													the funds of hundreds or even thousands of small investors.  The pool of funds is therefore large enough to access these 
													potentially higher yielding investments.  <br><br>

													Mutual fund investors also benefit from the investment management expertise and market knowledge of the team of 
													professional fund managers that manages the pool of funds.  These fund managers ensure that the funds are optimally 
													invested and diversified at all times. Therefore, you don’t need to watch the markets yourself since there is a team 
													that is already doing it for you.

													Mutual funds are not time deposits and therefore do not pay out a fixed rate of return. Mutual funds invest in stocks 
													listed on the stock exchange as well as bonds issued by the government and corporations. As a result, the value of your 
													investment fluctuates daily depending on the performance of the underlying investments.  Because of this, your return 
													cannot be guaranteed. Your actual rate of return depends on many factors such as the performance of the underlying 
													investments as well as general market and economic conditions.  However, over the long-term, investments in mutual funds 
													outperform traditional time deposit placements.

													As with all other investment instruments, investing in mutual funds involves a certain amount of risk. Stock and 
													bond prices go up and down daily.  So as the value of the underlying instruments in which the pool of funds was 
													invested fluctuates, so does the value of your mutual fund investments.  Depending on market conditions, there may be 
													periods in which you may lose money.  However, until you actually liquidate or withdraw your investment from the fund, 
													these will simply remain “paper losses” which can be recovered when market conditions stabilize.
													<br>
													<br>
													Moreover, the fund managers of the fund also do several things to control and minimize risk. First, they analyze all investments 
													thoroughly before including any stock or bond in the portfolio.  Second, they ensure that the fund is properly diversified, i.e.,
													invested in many different stocks or bonds.  As such, a drop in the price of one investment may be off-set by gains in another. 
													Third, the fund managers are subject to regulatory and internal investment restrictions that prevent the fund from being invested 
													from certain speculative investments and encourage proper diversification
													<br>
													<br>
													 While there are risks in mutual fund investing, the returns can also be rewarding in the long-run. There is always a risk-return 
													 trade-off in any investment.  What is important is to know how much risk you are willing and able to take and select an investment 
													 whose risk profile matches yours.

													Diversification simply means “not putting all your eggs in one basket”.  This is especially important in investing.  In a well-diversified 
													portfolio, losses from some investments can be off-set by gains in other investments.  This reduces the overall fluctuations or volatility
													 of the value of the portfolio. By investing in a mutual fund, you gain instant access to a diversified portfolio of investments. It is,
													  however, also important to realize that not all risk can be diversified away. There are certain economic, market and political factors 
													  which may affect all investments adversely.

													You can participate by buying shares of the mutual fund.  The price of these shares, also known as the Net Asset Value Per Share or NAVPS, 
													changes daily depending on the performance of the underlying investment portfolio.   As the NAVPS increases, the value of your investment 
													also increases.  The mechanics of investing in a mutual fund are very similar to buying shares in the stock market. <strong> The specific 
													requirements for investing in one of Philequity’s funds are listed in a separate section of this website.</strong>

													The net asset value per share (NAVPS) is the value of each share of a mutual fund. A fund's NAVPS is calculated daily and is the price 
													used when purchasing or selling mutual fund shares. To determine the value of your shares, simply multiply the number of shares you own 
													by the NAVPS.

													No. A mutual fund is not a deposit product and is, therefore, not covered by the PDIC.  However, when you invest in a 
													mutual fund, you are considered a shareholder and in effect are entitled to your proportional share in the total 
													assets of the fund.  The PDIC, on the other hand, only insures up to P250,000 of your total deposits with a bank 
													and not your entire investment amount.
