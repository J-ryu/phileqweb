    <br><font color="black"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt">This past week has proven to be a very volatile one. Protests in Hong Kong over universal suffrage has roiled both its economy and stock market, with the Hang Seng index dropping more than 4% in 3 days. In Indonesia, Parliament voted to scrap direct elections, threatening Prime Ministerelect Joko Widodo's ability to institute reforms. Launched by the losing opposition party, this brought back fears that political reform in Indonesia is taking a step backward. The Jakarta Composite index dropped nearly 3% in 1 day.</font></font></span></div>

  <div class="left">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt">
      <p>Developed markets were not spared either. The S&P
500 and Dow Jones have lost more than 2% this week
as strong economic data increased the probability of
interest rates being raised sooner rather than later.
Small cap and momentum stocks were battered even
more as traders shifted to defensive stocks. European
indices lost as much as 3% last night as ECB President
Mario Draghi ruled out an aggressive QE program in the
near term. Investors were hoping for more aggressive
actions from the central bank as the Eurozone economy
weakened.</p>
      <p>Although global markets have been volatile,
differentiation is crucial. Note how the problems
discussed above are isolated to particular countries.
Thus, if equity indices with no underlying problems also
correct as a result of these, it actually creates a buying
opportunity. The Philippine peso has likewise stabilized
after hitting resistance of 45. Since the Philippines does
not have problems of these magnitude, we continue to
recommend buying on pullbacks.</P>

  <p>Support at 7,150-7,200 is still holding despite weakness in both
developed and emerging markets. However, we recommend stock
picking over buying the broad market. We have identified support
levels of the stocks we like and we are buyers as prices approach
these levels. We should also be watchful of the peso as sharp
moves can start to affect equities.</p></span></div>
