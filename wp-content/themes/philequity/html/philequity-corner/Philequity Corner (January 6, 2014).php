        <p align="center"><b>2013 Scorecard</b></p>
        <p align="justify">In an article we wrote exactly one year ago (see Global Bull Market, January 7, 2013), we said that:</p>
        <p><i>“In a period of slow global economic growth and looming deflation brought about by the European debt
crisis and the US subprime crisis, we now consider quantitative easing (QE) and low interest rates as
the greatest gift to us by Bernanke and other central bankers...</i></p>
        <p><i>Thanks to the central banks, we are now witnessing a global bull market in stocks.”</i></p>

        <p align="center"><b>The year of the bull</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Looking back, global equities undeniably went on a bull rampage in 2013. Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a 56.7 percent return, its biggest gain in 41 years. The US S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had their biggest yearly gains since 1996, up 29.6% and 26.5%, respectively.</p>

        <p>The S&P 500 Index and the DJIA also registered new record highs. In Europe, the German DAX index surged 25.5 percent en route to a new record high.</p>

        <p>A number of emerging markets including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Mexico, Turkey and South Africa also recorded new all-time equity highs in 2013. Most have corrected since May 2013 after Bernanke first hinted “QE tapering” (with the exception of Malaysia and South Africa).</p>

        <p>Overall, more than 80 percent of indices that are listed in Bloomberg’s World Equity Indices (WEI) list showed positive returns for 2013.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Shift from EM to DM</b></p>
        <p align="justify">A major development that happened in 2013 is the shift of capital flows from emerging markets (EM) to developed markets (DM) after Bernanke’s “tapering” speech on May 22, 2013. This triggered large-scale unwinding, deleveraging and repatriation of funds. Hence, erstwhile emerging market leaders such as Turkey, Mexico and the ASEAN-3 (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand) which led from 2012 up to the 2nd quarter of 2013, ended the year flat or slightly down.</p>

        <p>At the same time, developed markets such as the US, Japan and even Europe started to show signs of economic improvement which translated to huge price gains in their stock markets last year.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>US dollar strength & Yen weakness</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Another key theme that influenced the markets last year was the US dollar strength and yen weakness. In fact, we wrote several articles about this which was highlighted by our call of a peso top (see <i>Peso Tops Out,</i> May 27, 2013), eight years after we called the bottom of the peso (see Peso, <i>The Strongest Currency in Asia</i>, October 24, 2005).</p>

        <p>Commodity currencies such as the Indonesian rupiah, South African rand, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar depreciated sharply as commodity prices softened in 2013.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Commodities tumbled</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Precious metals and other commodities tumbled in 2013. In fact, 20 out of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI index declined last year. Silver plunged 35.9 percent and gold plummeted nearly 30 percent to mark their biggest annual declines since 1981.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>EM weaknesses highlighted</b></p>
        <p align="justify">The exodus of funds that was triggered by the talks of QE tapering highlighted the weaknesses of economies with huge current account deficits and high inflation, such as India and Indonesia. This exacerbated the declines in their respective currencies which inevitably affected regional currencies such as the peso.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>PSEi: Post-taper talk & Post-Yolanda</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Last week, we discussed the reasons why the PSEi and the peso swung from being the best to worst in a span of one year (see <i>From Best to Worst</i>, December 30, 2013). But aside from the Fed’s tapering of QE which affected everyone, the Philippines was affected by a barrage of problems towards the latter part of the year (torrent of share issuances, pork barrel scam, Zamboanga siege, earthquake, and the straw that broke the camel’s back, Yolanda).</p>

        <p>Like we said in our article last week, market sentiment can change easily. Last year, we saw how
sentiment can turn against us in such a short period of time. Similarly, sentiment changed in Indonesia
when its huge current account deficit was exposed and in Thailand because of political turmoil and
prospect of a coup d’etat. Equity markets from these ASEAN countries which run up “too fast too soon”
in prior years, pulled back last year with double digit losses.</p>

        <p>But from the bear market bottom of 2009, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines still performed very
well, up 232%, 211% and 206%, respectively. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index is up 170 percent from
the March 6, 2009 low. Hence, from a longer term perspective, the US and other equity markets are just
catching up with us.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Peso: Post-taper talk & Post-Yolanda</b></p>
        <p align="justify">While the PSEi dropped sharply post-taper talk and post-Yolanda, the peso was more stable relative to the
region. Going forward, the peso remains vulnerable to further weakness given the continued strength of
the US dollar, and the weakness of the yen and other ASEAN currencies.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Big Picture 2014</b></p>
        <p align="justify">2013 was a classic breakout year for the US and other developed markets such as Japan and Germany.
With the exception of the Nasdaq, the major US indices have all broken to new all time highs and many
by over double digits. The Nikkei made the biggest yearly gain in four decades. Meanwhile, stock
markets in troubled EU countries like Spain and Italy showed much improvement.</p>

        <p>Our view is that if the breakout holds for these three major markets (US, Japan and Europe) and the US continues its strong economic recovery this year then we will see a rebound in emerging markets in 2014. In addition, China should show signs of resolving its structural problems (e.g. liquidity squeezes, ballooning local government debts, etc.). If these happen, expect the peso and Philippine stocks to recover together with other emerging market currencies and equities.</p>
