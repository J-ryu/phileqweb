        <p align="center"><b>The Fear Before the Storm</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Last week, the stock market experienced a 2-day, 2% drop as investors sold in fear of the aptly named
typhoon called Hagupit. The fact that this sharp selldown occurred even before the typhoon entered the
Philippine area of responsibility just shows how fearful investors are of the coming super typhoon.</p>
    
        <p align="center"><b>Fear of the unknown</b></p>
        <p align="justify">As forecasts from the various weather bureaus came in, there were varying estimates of its strength,
with some saying it is close to Yolanda’s power. Fears were exacerbated by news that Hagupit may hit
Metro Manila. Although no one really knew exactly how damaging this storm would be, the fear of the
unknown brought down our stock market even before Hagupit could do any damage to the countryside.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Foreign hedge funds sell in anticipation of a super typhoon</b></p>
        <p align="justify">When Yolanda struck last year, it was not only the countryside that was ravaged but the stock market as
well, causing the index to drop as much as 13% over a month. With memories of how the stock market
crumbled due to the onslaught of Yolanda fresh in their mind, investors were expecting the worst. Last
Thursday, when all Asian markets were up, the Philippines was the only one in the red. Foreign hedge
funds with no love lost for the Philippines sold and shorted our stock market as they anticipated a sharp
drop in stock prices, similar to what happened post-Yolanda. In just 2 days, foreign funds net sold nearly
PhP 3 billion worth of equities (excluding Petron block sales).</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Local fund managers exercise caution and prudence</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Local fund managers and long term investors remained on the sidelines, choosing to exercise caution
and prudence as they wait for the aftermath of the storm before buying heavily. With fear pervading the
markets, the PSEi shed as much as 182 points in 2 days even before the typhoon struck.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>A stark contrast</b></p>
        <p align="justify">It is important to highlight the stark contrast between the stock market’s reaction to Yolanda last year
and its reaction to Hagupit this year. Last year, investors underestimated the impact of Yolanda. In fact,
the PSEi remained steady even after Yolanda struck. It was only when economic damage and actual
casualty figures came trickling in that the stock market began to fall. Thus, as these numbers started
adding up to the billions of dollars and thousands of dead, the market kept dropping as foreign and local
funds alike sold their positions. Compare this to the sharp correction of the PSEi last week even before
Hagupit entered the Philippine area of responsibility.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Nothing to fear but fear itself</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Fortunately for our countrymen, as the storm moved closer to the Philippines, it lost a significant
amount of strength. As of this writing, Hagupit has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm from
Category 5 and is packing maximum winds of just 175kph from 250 kph. Thus, the much-feared Hagupit
lost its super typhoon status. Similar to the Ebola scare that happened in the 1st half of October, it seems that fear has caused more damage to stock prices than the actual event itself (see <i>Epidemic of Fear</i>, 20
October 2014). Although Hagupit will still bring torrential rains to parts of the Philippines, the damage it
will deal is a far cry from the havoc wreaked by Yolanda. However, the drop in the stock market last
week clearly shows that some fund managers will sell first and ask questions later. It is precisely this fear
of possible widespread damage that has caused premature corrections in the stock market, regardless
of whether it materializes or not.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Largest peacetime evacuation in Philippine history</b></p>
        <p align="justify">With forecasts from weather bureaus all over the world including PAGASA, government agencies were
able to act quickly. As of this writing, about 700,000 people had been evacuated from their homes, with
the UN citing this as the largest peacetime evacuation in Philippine history. Adequate supplies of basic
necessities were also shipped ahead of time to evacuation centers in critical areas. Police, military and
medical personnel have also been deployed even before the typhoon strikes in order to maintain peace
and order, as well as coordinate the mass evacuations. With the Yolanda experience in mind, our
government is clearly doing the best it can to minimize the damage and casualties from this storm. We
commend our government for its thorough preparation and decisive action against Hagupit.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>Prepare for the worst and hope for the best</b></p>
        <p align="justify">These repeated warnings and comparisons to Yolanda struck fear in the hearts of our countrymen,
especially those who live in areas ravaged by Yolanda last year. In critical areas like Leyte, Samar and
Masbate, grocery shelves were emptied and gasoline stations were pumped dry as panic buying set in
last week. Everyone in the path of the storm, especially those who suffered from Yolanda, were
preparing for the worst.</p>

        <p>Sometimes though, fear can be useful if it leads to adequate preparation. Last year, barely anyone even
knew what a storm surge was. Thus, President Aquino made sure that everyone used the lessons from
Yolanda to improve their response, saying he “will be unforgiving of failure” this time around. True
enough, government agencies were very proactive in preventing widespread casualties. With all the
preventive measures in place, everyone is hoping for the best and praying that Hagupit does not live up
to its name.</p>

            <p align="center"><b>You are not alone</b></p>
        <p align="justify">For our countrymen who are facing the brunt of Hagupit, the proactive moves of the government are
reassuring and sends the message that you are not alone. The entire country is watching the storm and
monitoring the situation in the various provinces. To end this article and express our sympathy, we leave
you with the song “You’ll Never Walk Alone” from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “The
Carousel”:</p>

        <p align="center"><b>You’ll Never Walk Alone</b></p>
        <p align="center">When you walk through a storm<br>Hold your head up high<br>And don't be afraid of the dark<br>At the end of a storm is a golden sky<br>And the sweet silver song of a lark</p>
        <p align="center">Walk on through the wind<br>Walk on through the rain<br>Though your dreams be tossed and blown<br>Walk on, walk on with a hope in your heart<br>And you'll never walk alone<br>You'll never, ever walk alone</p>
