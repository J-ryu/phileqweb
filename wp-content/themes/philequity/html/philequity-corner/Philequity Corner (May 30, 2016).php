        <div align="justify" class="page">
            <p>In the lead-up to the elections, we wrote an article about the Duterte groundswell phenomenon. We
tried to understand how Rodrigo Duterte captured the imagination and adulation of Filipinos from all
walks of life. We talked to various people from different classes and backgrounds – from taxi drivers and
messengers to office employees and businessmen – in order to appreciate the reasons behind Duterte’s
sudden popularity. Moreover, we were amazed at how his grassroots campaign was fuelled by the
citizenry itself. The Duterte groundswell took everyone by surprise as the combined efforts of dedicated
volunteers and ardent supporters overcame the established machinery and political connections of his
opponents. We said that this phenomenon is something that sociologists and political analysts should
study and comprehend (see <i>Groundswell,</i> April 18, 2016). After it catapulted the Punisher to be our next
president, we have seen that the groundswell has started spreading to our stock market.</p>

        <br><p><b>Groundswell reaches the stock market</b></p></span>

        <div align="justify" class="page">
            <p>As the elections drew closer, several analysts and houses turned extremely bearish with regards to
Duterte’s impending win. Many painted doomsday scenarios, predicted a sharp stock market correction
and expected the worst out of a Duterte presidency. However, the index actually went up 6% three
weeks after the elections despite encountering brief corrections. These short-term downmoves were
triggered by contemplated contentious Cabinet appointments and the recent overnight placement of JG
Summit Holdings (JGS). Yet, many analysts still insist that the recent market move is just a technical rally
especially since the PSE Index is still far away from its all-time closing high of 8,127. They also cite that
our index has reached technical resistance at the 7,400 to 7,500 level. <b>However, it may have come
unnoticed that many index stocks have recently reached all-time highs. The failure of the PSE Index to
reach new highs has masked the underlying strength of Philippine stocks.</b></p>

    <div align="center" class="page">
        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>All-time highs</b></p></span>

        <div align="justify" class="page">
            <p>As we show in the table below, 7 out of the 30 index constituents, accounting for 41% of the PSE Index,
reached new all-time highs after the elections.</p>

        <div align="center" class="page">

        <td align="left"><img src="image/053016chart.jpg" height="300" width="400"></td>

        <p align="justify">Apart from these, there are other index stocks that recently reached multi-year highs such as Metro
Pacific Investments Corp (MPI), Meralco (MER) and GT Capital Holdings (GTCAP). Moreover, if not for the substantial drop of PLDT (TEL), the PSE Index would now be trading at much higher levels. <b>Lastly, the
fact that many index stocks are trading at all-time or multi-year highs is a manifestation of a vibrant
bull market.</b></p>


<div align="center" class="page">
        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>JGS placement shows strong demand for Philippine stocks</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">Another evidence of our stock market’s strength is the overnight placement of JGS last week. JGS
Chairman Emeritus John Gokongwei sold the equivalent of $250m or ~P11.7b, priced at P82.10/sh. The
fact that a local conglomerate can conduct a placement of such amount over a few hours shows that
there is strong demand not only for JGS shares but also for Philippine stocks in general.</b></p>

        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>Peso – The Only Gainer</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">Aside from the recent move of the PSE Index, the strength of the Philippine peso is an indication of
confidence resulting from the electoral victory of the Punisher. Though most currencies weakened
against the US dollar, the peso has managed to stay firm and has posted a gain vs. the dollar. <b>Thus, the
peso has been a clear outperformer vs. major currencies and other Asian currencies in the past month
or so</b> (see table below).</b></p>

        <br><p><b>Understanding the groundswell in the stock market</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">The Duterte groundswell started to spread to the stock market on the very first day after the elections.
Before the elections, many adopted a wait-and-see stance because of negative expectations from a
Duterte presidency. Thus, investors were pleasantly surprised when the Duterte team made its first
pronouncements after winning the elections. The incoming administration stated that it would continue
current successful macroeconomic policies, accelerate infrastructure spending and address bottlenecks
in project implementation. Brewing confidence in the stock market was spurred by the presentation of
the Duterte government’s 8-point economic agenda. The appointments of Sonny Dominguez as DOF
Secretary, Art Tugade as DOTC Secretary, Ernesto Pernia as NEDA Chief, Silvestre Bello III as DOLE
Secretary, as well as other credible people to key Cabinet posts, further buoyed stock market sentiment.</p>


<div align="center" class="page">
        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>Inspiring confidence</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">A very important member of the Duterte team is incoming DOF Secretary Sonny Dominguez. He has a
solid reputation among businessmen and people who know him. He knows how business works since he is a businessman and was president of various big companies. He also knows how the government works, having served as Agriculture Secretary during the Cory Aquino administration.</p>
<p align="justify">Sonny has been closely coordinating with outgoing Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima to ensure the continuity of ongoing initiatives. On top of this, he has been busy doing the rounds, holding meetings with different sectors and various captains of industry. In those meetings, Sonny has been consultative and has always been willing to listen. Moreover, he has proactively sought feedback and suggestions in order to formulate policies that will work best for our country and economy. Thus, many view him as the right conduit to explain the Duterte enigma to businessmen. <b>Sonny’s presence in the Duterte team has inspired confidence from the business and investment community.</b></p>


<div align="center" class="page">
        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>Capitalizing on the groundswell</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">Our country continues to benefit from strong fundamentals, as seen in our economy’s 6.9% GDP growth in 1Q16. Robust domestic consumption continues to drive our economic growth. Meanwhile, our stellar fiscal position ensures that the government has the leeway and the resources to fund and support our country’s ongoing structural transformation. Thus, the incoming administration is in a prime position to capitalize on the Duterte groundswell and his strong mandate. The Duterte team should therefore continue to build on our country’s strengths. <b>Key initiatives include improving our country’s business competitiveness, opening various sectors to foreign investors and implementing a comprehensive tax reform package. We note that these will not only strengthen our economy but will also serve as positive catalysts for the ongoing Philippine secular bull market.</b></p>

<div align="center" class="page">
        <span FONT-SIZE: 25pt">
        <br><p><b>Long-term trajectory is up</b></p></span>

     
        <p align="justify">A correction is possible considering the recent post-election surge of Philippine stocks. This may be triggered by technical reasons (as the PSE Index is trading at resistance levels), additional placements by listed companies that may sap market liquidity and a probable Fed rate hike within the next few months. Notwithstanding, we believe that our stock market’s long-term trajectory is up. If Duterte successfully capitalizes on the groundswell that propelled him to the presidency, then our stock market may reach new highs in the next year or so. As we have shown, many index stocks have already reached new all-time highs in the few weeks after the elections. <b>It is thus incumbent upon us Filipinos to unite and support incoming President Duterte and his team, as they seek to implement initiatives that will result in a better Philippines, a healthier economy and a stronger stock market.</b></p>
